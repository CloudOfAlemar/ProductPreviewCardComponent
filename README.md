### What I learned

Hello everyone, here is my Product Preview Card Component solution
to the Frontend Mentor challenge. I enjoy creating these small components
because they help me feel more comfortable with writing code. I find that
planning my projects out beforehand , such as: which HTML tags I'll be using, which class names to use, and simply planning out the project helps the creating process run smoothly. I will continue to create projects to improve myself everyday.
